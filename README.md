# nanoid-good

Guarantees you will not get any obscene words or other profanity in your ids generated by [Nano ID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid).

This is a drop-in replacement for **Nano ID** which means you can just change the name of imported package from `nanoid` to `nanoid-good`.

## Installation

```shell
npm install nanoid-good
```

## Usage

```js
var nanoid = require("nanoid-good");
var id = nanoid(); //=> "V1StGXR8_Z5jdHi6B~myT"
```

All additional functions of **Nano ID** are supported too:

```js
var format = require("nanoid-good/format");
var generate = require("nanoid-good/generate");
var nonSecure = require("nanoid-good/non-secure");

var id1 = format(random, "abcdef", 5);
var id2 = generate("1234567abcdef", 10);
var id3 = nonSecure();
```

## How it works

It checks every generated ID through a vocabulary of obscene words. If any match is found, then ID is generated again and again until it gets clean ID which is returned.

It finds bad words with mixed registry and words which are hidden in between other letters. 

For example:

`Uakgb_J5m9g~0JDMpoRnqLJ`

This one will be considered a bad word because of `poRn` hidden near the end.
